# Tetris_Rush
### A Python program based on the famous game of Tetris.  

The rules of the game are the following:
- To score a point, you must have 4 vertically aligned blocks of the same color.
- With each block that falls down without you scoring a point, the next block will fall faster.
- Every time you score a point, the blocks you matched disappear, the falling blocks' speed resets to the default speed and increases according to the rule above.
- You lose the game once the screen is full of unmatched blocks.  

#### How to run the program:
- Make sure you have Processing3 installed.
- Open the source code, which will take you to the Processing 3 software.
- Click on the play button to start the game.
